title: "Crosstalk"
---

A package for R that enhances [htmlwidgets](http://htmlwidgets.org) with client side, inter-widget interactions (currently linked brushing and filtering).

## Background

While the whole point of HTML Widgets is to allow you to easily create interactive HTML visualizations from R, the kind of interactivity they enable is generally _intra-widget_, meaning interactive things happen within the boundaries of the HTML element they inhabit (hover over a data point to see a tooltip, drag over a range of the time series to zoom in).

The other kind of interactivity is _inter-widget_, meaning that user gestures on one widget can affect other widgets. The most common example is [linked brushing](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063663), where selecting points on one view of the data highlights those same observations in other views of the data. (Linked brushing is already possible in some libraries like [Plotly](https://plot.ly/r/), but again, only between sub-plots of a single composite Plotly plot, so still intra-widget.)

## What is Crosstalk?

Crosstalk can be thought of as an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It provides widget authors with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing standard interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering) in a standard way.

By standardizing on a set of interactions, we can let widget users coordinate widgets with surprisingly little code.

Here's an example using R Markdown:

<pre class="markdown"><code>---
title: Fiji earthquakes
output: html_document
---

&#96;``{r}
library(htmltools)
library(crosstalk)
library(leaflet)
library(DT)

# Wrap data frame in SharedData
sd <- SharedData$new(quakes)

# Create a filter input
filter_slider("mag", "Magnitude", sd, column = ~mag, step = 0.1)

# Use SharedData like a dataframe with Crosstalk-enabled widgets
leaflet(sd) %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers()
datatable(sd)
&#96;``</code></pre>

We wrap the data frame `quakes` in a `SharedData` R6 object to signal to widgets and filter inputs that they should link up to other Crosstalk-enabled widgets/inputs that use the same `SharedData` object.

Here are the results:

## Important limitations

There are inherent limitations in the current version of Crosstalk that widget authors and users need to be aware of.

1. **Crosstalk currently only works for linked brushing and filtering of views that show individual data points, not aggregate or summary views** (where "observations" is defined as a single row in a data frame). For example, histograms are not supported since each bar represents multiple data points; but scatter plot points each represent a single data point, so they are supported.
2. Because all data must be loaded into the browser, **Crosstalk is not appropriate for large data sets**. (There's no hard limit, since HTML widgets require varying amounts of CPU cycles and memory for each data point.)
